# Moving or Renaming the Project Folder

## ✅ Safe to Move/Rename

**Yes, you can safely move the project folder to another location and rename it without breaking the project.**

---

## 🔍 What I Checked

### ✅ No Hard-Coded Paths in Code
- All code uses relative paths
- No absolute paths in source files
- Build configurations use relative paths

### ✅ Safe Files
- **Git repository** - Uses relative paths
- **Android build files** - Use relative paths
- **iOS Xcode project** - Xcode handles path updates automatically
- **Source code** - All relative paths

### ⚠️ Files That Will Auto-Update

#### Android
- **`android/local.properties`** - Auto-generated by Android Studio
  - Contains SDK path (machine-specific)
  - Already in `.gitignore`
  - Will be recreated automatically when you open project

#### iOS  
- **Xcode project files** - Xcode updates paths automatically
  - `.xcodeproj` files contain paths, but Xcode manages them
  - Just open the project in new location

## 📋 Steps After Moving

### 1. Android Project
```bash
# Navigate to new location
cd /new/path/to/project/android

# Android Studio will:
# - Auto-detect new location
# - Regenerate local.properties
# - Update any internal paths
```

**What to do:**
- Open Android Studio
- Open the project from new location
- Android Studio will handle everything automatically

### 2. iOS Project
```bash
# Navigate to new location
cd /new/path/to/project/ios

# Open in Xcode
open Ciphio/Ciphio.xcodeproj
```

**What to do:**
- Open Xcode
- Open the project from new location
- Xcode will update internal paths automatically

### 3. Git (if using)
```bash
# Git doesn't care about folder location
# Just continue using git normally
cd /new/path/to/project
git status  # Should work fine
```

## ⚠️ What Might Need Manual Update

### Documentation Files
Some documentation files have example paths like:
- `/Users/qaantum/Desktop/Project/CiphioVault/android`
- These are just **examples** in guides
- They won't break anything, but you might want to update them later

**Files with example paths:**
- `docs/guides/android/*.md` - Example commands
- `docs/guides/ios/*.md` - Example paths
- These are documentation only, not used by code

### IDE Settings (Optional)
- **Android Studio/IntelliJ**: 
  - If you see "VCS root configuration problems" warning:
    - Go to Settings → Version Control → Directory Mappings
    - Remove the mapping for `CiphioVault` (it's not a separate Git repo)
    - Keep only the parent directory (`/Users/qaantum/Desktop/Project`) mapped to Git
    - The IDE will auto-detect the Git repo from the parent directory
- **Xcode**: May need to re-index (automatic)
- **VS Code/Cursor**: Should auto-detect new location

## ✅ Quick Checklist

After moving/renaming:

- [ ] Open Android project in Android Studio (from new location)
- [ ] Open iOS project in Xcode (from new location)  
- [ ] Verify builds work: `./gradlew build` (Android)
- [ ] Test that git still works: `git status`
- [ ] (Optional) Update documentation paths if you want

## 🎯 Summary

**You're safe to move/rename!**

The project is designed to be portable:
- ✅ No hard-coded absolute paths in code
- ✅ All paths are relative
- ✅ Build tools handle path updates automatically
- ✅ Git works from any location

**Just open the project from the new location and everything should work!**
