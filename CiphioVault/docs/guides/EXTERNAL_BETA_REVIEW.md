**What it is:** Apple reviews your app before external testers can access it

## What Apple Reviews

**For external beta testing, Apple checks:**
- ✅ App doesn't crash on launch

- ✅ No obvious violations of App Store guidelines
- ✅ App is testable (not completely broken)

**They DON'T check:**
- ❌ Complete feature set
- ❌ Polish/design quality

## Why It's Required

**External testers** can be:
- Anyone with the TestFlight link
- Up to 10,000 testers
- Public link sharing

**So Apple reviews it** to ensure:

### If Rejected:
