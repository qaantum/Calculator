## 4. Sign-In Information

**What it is:** Credentials for Apple reviewers to test your app

**Important:** For a password manager, reviewers need to be able to test the app.

### Sign-in required:
✅ **Yes** (check this box)

**Why:** Users must set up a master password to use the app

### User Name:
```
Leave blank
```

**Why:** Users create their own master password - there's no username

### Password:
```
Leave blank
```

**Why:** Users create their own master password on first launch

### Notes (if there's a notes field):
```
Users must set up a master password on first launch. No demo account needed - reviewers should create their own master password to test the app. The app uses local encryption only - no cloud sync. All data is stored locally on the device.
```

---

## Alternative: If You Need Demo Account

**If Apple requires a demo account** (they might for password managers):

### Option 1: Create Test Data

**Notes field:**
```
No demo account needed. Reviewers should:
1. Launch the app
2. Set up a master password (any password works)
3. Add test password entries
4. Test AutoFill functionality

The app works completely offline - no server or account required.
```

### Option 2: Provide Test Credentials

**If they insist on credentials:**

**User Name:**
```
reviewer
```

**Password:**
```
TestPassword123
```

**Notes:**
```
Demo account for review. Master password: TestPassword123
The app requires setting up a master password on first launch. Use the credentials above to test the app.
```

**But for password managers, usually no demo account is needed** - reviewers can create their own.
