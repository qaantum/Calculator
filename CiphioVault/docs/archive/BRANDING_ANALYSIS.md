## 💭 My Honest Opinion

**Change it to "Cipher"** or similar now while it's easy. Here's why:

1. **"Crypto" baggage**: The crypto/blockchain association is strong and negative for many users post-2022 crash
2. **Limited branding**: "Ciphio" doesn't sell the password manager (your key differentiator)
3. **Low cost now**: Takes 30 minutes to rename everything before launch
4. **High cost later**: Impossible to change after App Store submission without losing momentum

But if you love "Ciphio", keep it and own it with strong positioning.
