## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Address Format

**Apple expects a specific format.** Make sure your address includes:

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ Street address (with building/house number)
- ✅ City
- ✅ State/Province/Region
- ✅ Postal/ZIP code
- ✅ Country

**Format Example:**
```
Street Address: Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok. No: X
City: Istanbul
State/Province: Bayrampasa
Postal Code: 34045
Country: Türkiye
```

---

### Issue 2: Address Too Vague

**Problem:** Address might be too general or missing details

**Solution:**
- ✅ Include building/house number if available
- ✅ Include apartment/unit number if applicable
- ✅ Use full street name (not abbreviations)
- ✅ Make sure postal code is correct

**Example:**
- ❌ "Istanbul, Türkiye" (too vague)
- ✅ "Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok. No: 5, Istanbul, Bayrampasa, 34045, Türkiye"

---

### Issue 3: Special Characters

**Problem:** Special characters might cause issues

**Solution:**
- ✅ Use standard characters (avoid special symbols)
- ✅ Use standard Turkish characters (ı, ş, ç, ğ, ü, ö) - these should be fine
- ✅ Avoid emojis or unusual symbols
- ✅ Use standard punctuation

---

### Issue 4: Postal Code Format

**Problem:** Postal code might be incorrect or in wrong format

**Solution:**
- ✅ Verify your postal code is correct
- ✅ Use 5-digit format: `34045`
- ✅ Make sure it matches your city/district

**Check:**
- Use Turkey's postal code lookup if needed
- Make sure postal code matches Bayrampasa district

---

### Issue 5: City/District Confusion

**Problem:** Apple might not recognize district names

**Solution:**
- ✅ Use "Istanbul" as the city
- ✅ Use "Bayrampasa" as district/neighborhood (if there's a separate field)
- ✅ Or combine: "Bayrampasa, Istanbul"

**Try these formats:**

**Format 1:**
```
Street: Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok.
City: Istanbul
State/Province: Bayrampasa
Postal Code: 34045
Country: Türkiye
```

**Format 2:**
```
Street: Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok.
City: Bayrampasa, Istanbul
State/Province: (leave blank or use "Istanbul")
Postal Code: 34045
Country: Türkiye
```

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Review Your Current Address

**From your profile, you have:**
```
Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok.
Istanbul
Bayrampasa
34045
Türkiye
```

### Step 2: Break It Down Into Fields

**Try this format:**

**Street Address:**
```
Cevatpasa mah. Selanik sok.
```
(Add building number if you have one: "No: X")

**City:**
```
Istanbul
```

**State/Province/Region:**
```
Bayrampasa
```
(Or try "Istanbul" if Bayrampasa doesn't work)

**Postal Code:**
```
34045
```

**Country:**
```
Türkiye
```
(Or try "Turkey" if Türkiye doesn't work)

---

### Step 3: Alternative Formats to Try

**If Format 1 doesn't work, try Format 2:**

**Street Address:**
```
Cevatpasa mahallesi Selanik sokagi
```

**City:**
```
Istanbul
```

**State/Province:**
```
Istanbul
```

**Postal Code:**
```
34045
```

**Country:**
```
Turkey
```

### Step 4: If Still Not Working

**Street Address:**
```
Cevatpasa Mahallesi, Selanik Sokagi, Bayrampasa
```

**City:**
```
Istanbul
```

**State/Province:**
```
Istanbul
```

**Postal Code:**
```
34045
```

**Country:**
```
Turkey
```

## Address Verification Tips

### 1. Use English Characters Where Possible

**If Turkish characters cause issues:**
- Try: "Cevatpasa mahallesi" instead of "Cevatpasa mah."
- Try: "Selanik sokagi" instead of "Selanik sok."
- Try: "Turkey" instead of "Türkiye"

### 2. Include All Required Fields

**Make sure you fill:**
- ✅ Street address (required)
- ✅ City (required)
- ✅ Postal code (required)
- ✅ Country (required)
- ✅ State/Province (might be required)

### 3. Verify Postal Code

**Check if 34045 is correct:**
- Use Turkey postal code lookup
- Verify it matches Bayrampasa district
- Make sure it's 5 digits

### 4. Try Different Country Names

**If "Türkiye" doesn't work:**
- Try: "Turkey"
- Try: "TR" (country code)
- Apple should accept both, but try "Turkey" first

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Simplify Address
