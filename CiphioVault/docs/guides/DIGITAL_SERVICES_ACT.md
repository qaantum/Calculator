## What is a "Trader" Under DSA?

**Under EU law, you're a "trader" if you:**
- ✅ Sell apps or in-app purchases (even if free now, but might monetize later)
- ✅ Act in a commercial or professional capacity
- ✅ Make money from your app (or plan to)
- ✅ Run a business (even as a sole proprietor)
- ✅ Distribute apps as part of your business activity

**You're NOT a trader if you:**
- ❌ Only develop apps as a hobby (no commercial intent)
- ❌ Never plan to monetize
- ❌ Don't distribute in the EU
- ❌ Only develop for personal use
